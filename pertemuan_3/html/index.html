		<h3>Hack time</h3>
		<p>
			Hacking together: facilitate the formation of groups by interest/[insert 
			your community's preferred format].
		</p>
	
		<h3>Speakers & facilitators</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			You and your co-organizers are encouraged to facilitate the workshops! 
			(You got it!) If you'd like extra help, invite open source project 
			owners/maintainers, leaders passionate about open source, and computer 
			science educators who support open source in your community to come speak 
			or help with meetup attendees. If there is an experienced open source 
			enthusiast in your community, reach out to them via email or on Twitter! 
			The worst that can happen is they're not able to attend :)
		</p>
	
		<h3>Food & drinks</h3>
		<p>
			Something delicious that your community will enjoy! Bonus: one or two 
			items that add a festive <a href="#"><b>fall/autumn</b></a> or <b>Oktoberfest mood</b>. Remember to 
			account for food allergies, preferences, and local alcohol consumption 
			laws (if alcohol is served).
		</p>
		
		<h3>Other fun ideas</h3>
		<p><ul>
			<li>First pull request of the evening to receive [insert prize].</li>
			<li>Raffle off 3â€“5 prizes to be given away at the end of the evening.</li>
			<li>Wrap up the event by inviting participants to share what they learned/worked on.</li>
		</ul></p>
